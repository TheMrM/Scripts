# Bash Script: File Backup

This Bash script automates the process of creating a directory structure, generating 10 .txt files within the "important" directory, copying them to the "backup" directory, and finally deleting the "important" directory.

## Usage

1. Make sure you have Bash installed on your system.

2. Clone or download the script to your desired location.

3. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the script is located.

4. Make the script executable by running the following command:

   ```bash
   chmod +x script.sh




Run the script by executing the fallowing command:

./script.sh

The script will create the necessary directory structure, generate 10 .txt files in the "important" directory, copy them to the "backup" directory, and then delete the "important" directory.

Monitor the output in the terminal to ensure the process completes successfully.
